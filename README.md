## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard is designed to analyze and visualize air quality data collected from monitoring stations across Madrid. The data spans from 2001 to 2023 and provides a comprehensive view of the atmospheric pollution levels in the city over time. The dashboard offers insights into key pollution metrics and their trends, helping decision-makers in the Área de Medio Ambiente del Ayuntamiento de Madrid to assess and track air quality.

## Project Background
The Comunidad de Madrid has implemented an Integrated Air Quality System that continuously monitors air pollution levels throughout the region. This system was launched in 2001, and since then, daily measurements have been recorded and stored. As of today, we have access to a dataset that contains daily pollution data for each year from 2001 to 2023.

The Área de Medio Ambiente del Ayuntamiento de Madrid has commissioned this project to develop a business intelligence (BI) system that enables the analysis of air quality trends over the years. The aim is to provide stakeholders with actionable insights into the city’s air quality.

## Key Features of the Dashboard
* Air Quality Indicators: Displays significant air quality metrics such as particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), ozone (O₃), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), and carbon monoxide (CO).

* Trend Analysis: Visualizes the evolution of pollution levels across the city from 2001 to 2023, showcasing the progression or improvement of air quality over time.

* Geographic Coverage: Includes data from various monitoring stations located throughout Madrid, enabling a spatial understanding of air pollution distribution.

* Year-over-Year Comparisons: Provides year-on-year analysis to identify any critical changes in pollution levels, whether improvements or deteriorations.

* Interactive Filtering: Users can filter data by specific years, pollutants, and stations, allowing for customized analysis based on different timeframes or locations.
